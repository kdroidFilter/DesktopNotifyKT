## üöÄ Overview

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This library is highly experimental, and bugs may occur. The API is subject to change.

This guide explains how to use the library in your KMP project.

## üì¶ Installation

To use this library, add the following dependency to your Kotlin project:

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.kdroidfilter:knotify:<version>")
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

The setup is platform-specific and involves initializing the notification settings for each platform where your app will run.

### üñ•Ô∏è Setup 

The notification initialization can be done in the `main` function:

```kotlin
NotificationInitializer.configure(
    AppConfig(
        appName = "My awesome app",
        smallIcon = Res.getUri("drawable/kdroid.png"),
    )
)
```

## ‚ú® Usage Example

The library uses a Kotlin DSL to define notifications in a declarative way, without the usual boilerplate code. Here are examples of how you can create and manage notifications:

### Creating and Sending a Notification Later

```kotlin
// Create a notification
val myNotification = notification(
    title = "Notification from Screen 1",
    message = "This is a test notification from Screen 1",
    largeImage = Res.getUri("drawable/kdroid.png"),
    onActivated = { Log.d("NotificationLog", "Notification 1 activated") },
    onDismissed = { reason -> Log.d("NotificationLog", "Notification 1 dismissed: $reason") },
    onFailed = { Log.d("NotificationLog", "Notification 1 failed") }
) {
    button(title = "Show Message from Button 1") {
        Log.d("NotificationLog", "Button 1 from Screen 1 clicked")
        onShowMessage("Button 1 clicked from Screen 1's notification")
    }
    button(title = "Hide Message from Button 2") {
        Log.d("NotificationLog", "Button 2 from Screen 1 clicked")
        onShowMessage(null)
    }
}

// Send it when needed
myNotification.send()

```

### Creating and Sending a Notification with Reference

```kotlin
// Send a notification immediately but keep a reference to it
val myNotification = sendNotification(
    title = "Immediate Notification with Reference",
    message = "This notification is sent immediately but can be manipulated later",
    onActivated = { Log.d("NotificationLog", "Notification activated") }
) {
    button(title = "Click Me") {
        Log.d("NotificationLog", "Button clicked")
    }
}

// Hide it later when needed
myNotification.hide()
```

With this DSL approach, you can create rich and interactive notifications while keeping the code clean and readable. The library handles all the necessary details, allowing you to focus on your app's core logic.


This code helps ensure that your app properly manages permissions, updating the notification state as permissions are granted or denied.

## ‚≠ê Features

- **Rich Interactive Notifications**: Use a Kotlin DSL to create rich notifications with multiple actions, images, and buttons.
- **Callbacks for User Interaction**: Handle user actions such as `onActivated`, `onDismissed`, and `onFailed` to add interactivity to your notifications.
- **Custom Actions**: Add buttons with custom actions to your notifications, such as showing or hiding messages.
- **Button Support**: Notifications can include interactive buttons, allowing users to take specific actions directly from the notification.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Seamless integration across Linux, Windows, and macOS with platform-specific considerations.

## üé® KNotify Compose

This module extends the KNotify library to support Compose UI elements in notifications.

### Features

- Render Composable UI elements as notification images
- Use the same familiar API as the core KNotify library
- Seamlessly integrate your Compose UI with desktop notifications

### Installation

To use the Compose extension, add the following dependency to your Kotlin project:

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.kdroidfilter:knotify-compose:<version>")
```

### Usage

```kotlin
// Create a notification with a Composable as the large image
val notification = notification(
    title = "Hello from Compose",
    message = "This notification has a Compose UI element as its image",
    largeIcon = {
        // Your Composable UI here
        // For example, a blue circle with text "KN" in the center
    }
)

// Send the notification
notification.send()

// Or create and send in one step
sendNotification(
    title = "Hello from Compose",
    message = "This notification has a Compose UI element as its image",
    largeIcon = {
        // Your Composable UI here
    }
)
```
